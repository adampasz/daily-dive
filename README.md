# DAILY DIVE

## Welcome!
The Daily Dive is a regular show on livecoding.tv about programming and software.  

The show is just starting up, and many of the early episodes will focus on simply putting the show together, including developing a schedule and topics.

Over time we will dive into topics like
* WebGL
* TypeScript
* Git
* Tmux
* Vim
* Zsh
* ...and more

Look in the "episodes" folder for details on particular show.

Also, for now, each episode will have its own branch so it will be easy to go back and enjoy a particular show.

## Prerequisites
The Daily Dive is aimed at intermediate-level developers.  To get the most out of the show, you should have some understanding of the following 
* JavaScript
* Basic UNIX Shell commands
* Vim
* Git/Github
