# DAILY DIVE

## Welcome!
The Daily Dive is a regular show on livecoding.tv about programming and software.  

The show is just starting up, and many of the early episodes will focus on simply putting the show together, including developing a schedule and topics.

Over time we will dive into topics like
* WebGL
* TypeScript
* Git
* Tmux
* Vim
* Zsh
* ...and more

Look in the "episodes" folder for details on particular show.

Also, for now, each episode will have its own branch so it will be easy to go back and enjoy a particular show.

## Schedule 
* Normal Schedule GMT (weekdays)
18:50 | prep. offline
19:00 | Scheduling next eps., plan today's show

I may need to deviate from the normal schedule when work or other obligations come up.

## Prerequisites
*Please note, my personal bias is toward using Vim and other command line tools, so that is what I will focus on during the show. Religious battles aside, it is important for developers to have at least a passing familiarity with these tools. Once you have learned them, you can make an informed decision as to whether they are right for you.*

The Daily Dive is aimed at intermediate-level developers.  To get the most out of the show, you should have some understanding of the following 

* JavaScript
* Basic UNIX Shell commands
* Vim
* Git/Github
